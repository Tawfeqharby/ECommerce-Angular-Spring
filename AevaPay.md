## First Phase
1- First to create your docker files will hte following:

    # Builing the base image 
    FROM  node:16.15.2-alpine  AS  appbuild
    WORKDIR  /app
    COPY  package.json  ./app
    RUN  npm  install
    COPY  .  ./app
    RUN  npm  run  test
    RUN  npm  run  build
    RUN  npm  run  lint
    # Build Stage 2
    # Building the final image based of the base image
    FROM  node:16.15.2-alpine
    WORKDIR  /app
    COPY  package.json  ./
    COPY  --from=appbuild  /app/dist  ./dist
    EXPOSE  4002
    CMD  npm  start


2- Create the environment variable file for each environment (DEV-UAT-PROD). so you will have dev.env , uat.env and prod.env .
each file contain the variables in each environment.
3- Create the  docker composer file  with following:

```
version: '3.4'
services:
backend:
   image: backend
   build:
   context: .
       dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
   ports:
       - 3000:3000
   volumes:
       - ./:/app
       - /app/node_modules
 ```
4- Run the docker composer command based on the env file that you did before with the following command:
```
docker-compose up --env-file dev.env -d 
```

5- Based on the following Github action Pipeline :
```
name: Build Docker Images
on:
   pull_request:
      branches:
         - dev
         - uat
         - main
jobs:
    build_docker_images:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

   steps:

    -
      name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
 
    -
      name: Docker meta
      id: docker_meta
      uses: crazy-max/ghaction-docker-meta@v1
      with:
        images: ghcr.io/awesomecompany/mlflow
        tag-sha: true

    -
      name: Set up QEMU
      uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1

    -
      name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    -
      name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        registry: ghcr.io
        username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
        password: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}

    -

      name: Build and push MLFlow image
      id: mlflow
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: ./
        file: ./mlflow/Dockerfile
        push: true
        tags: ${{ steps.docker_meta.outputs.tags }}
        
   ```

So the Pipeline is :

 1. make checkout step and based on the Triger that run when push happens  on the branch.
 2. Build the docker image, and inside the docker image we make all the phases to build and test and lint.
 3. we provide which Registry for example Docker Hub with credential.
 4. Push the image in your private registry.
 5. You can use it after using docker compose or in Kubernetes using Deployment file. or We can package it to Helm charts and install the chart in our Kubernetes cluster.


### Second phase
Design our infrastructure that host the application:

 -  I will choose EKS service in Amazon.
        - you will find the design in the the same git repo.
        - It is EKS design.  Here is the list of used service: 
 
 
 - EKS service: Managed kubernetes Cluster.  2- RDS: for MYSQL database. 
 -   All basic networking in AWS.  4- Elastic cashe : for Redis memory database. 
 - Prometheus and Grafana for monitor our application. 
 -  Inside the cluster we will use 
 -  Nginx Ingress Controller.
 -  Deployments.
 -  Service ClusterIP.
 -  PODs.
 -  We can use ArgoCD for continuous deployment.
